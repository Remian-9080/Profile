## 📁 Projects

### 🔍 <span style="color: white;">Towards Accurate AI-Driven Historical QA</span>  
**A Retrieval-Augmented Model for Bangladeshi History**

Recent advancements in LLMs have revolutionized QA, but challenges like **hallucinations** and **misinformation** persist.  
Our project, **QA**, is an **Open Source Conversational AI** for Bangladesh's history, integrating **LLMs with human-verified data** to maintain high accuracy.  
This approach enables scalable, domain-specific chat models with reliable information integrity.
